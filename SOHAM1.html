<h1>Shubhanshu Shukla </title>
<p>Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (nicknamed Shux[3]) is an Indian Air Force test pilot and ISRO astronaut. He is the first of four astronauts who has flown to space as part of the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme[4][5] and is currently on-board Axiom Mission 4.

Early life and education
Shubhanshu Shukla, a native of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, completed his schooling at City Montessori School, Aliganj. Inspired by the 1999 Kargil War, he independently applied for and cleared the UPSC NDA examination. He completed his military training and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the National Defence Academy in 2005.

He was then selected for the flying branch and underwent training at the Indian Air Force Academy. In June 2006, he was commissioned into the Fighter stream of the Indian Air Force as a Flying officer.[6][7][8]

Indian Air Force career
He is a combat leader and seasoned test pilot with about 2,000 hours of flying experience in various aircraft, including the Su-30 MKI, MiG-21, MiG-29, Jaguar, Hawk, Dornier 228, and An-32.[9][10]

ISRO astronaut career
Training
Shubhanshu Shukla was included in the astronaut selection process in 2019 by the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), an organization under the Indian Air Force for the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. Later, he was shortlisted in the final four by IAM and ISRO. In 2020, He went to Russia for basic training with three other selected astronauts at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. Basic training was completed in 2021. He then returned to India and attended training at the Astronaut Training Facility in Bangalore. During this time period, he completed his Master of Technology degree from IISc Bangalore in Aerospace Engineering.[5]

His name as a member of the astronaut team was first officially announced in public on 27 February 2024, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the names of the astronaut team members for India's first human space mission at ISRO's Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram.[5][11]

Axiom Mission 4
Shubhanshu is currently serving as the mission pilot for the ongoing Axiom Mission 4 mission to the International Space Station, that launched to space on 25 June 2025 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.[12] He is part of a crew led by commander Peggy Whitson, alongside mission specialists Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski and Tibor Kapu. Fellow ISRO astronaut Prasanth Nair was designated as the backup crew member; both underwent training at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.

The mission, a collaboration between NASA, SpaceX, and ISRO, is intended to strengthen international spaceflight cooperation. Shukla is the first Indian astronaut to visit the ISS, and the second Indian to travel to orbit, after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma. The cost of his seat is estimated to be in the “mid-$60-million range” (approximately ₹500 crore).

Shukla's enthusiastic message from space marked India's return to human spaceflight programme -

"Namaskar, my dear countrymen! What a ride! We are back in the space once again after 41 years. It's an amazing ride. We are revolving around the Earth at a speed of 7.5 kilometres per second. The Tiranga embossed on my shoulders tells me that I am with all of you. This journey of mine is not a beginning to the International Space Station (ISS) but to India's Human Space Programme. I want all of you to be part of this journey. Your chest, too, should swell with pride...Together, let's initiate India's Human Space Programme. Jai Hind! Jai Bharat!"
